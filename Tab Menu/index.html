        <div class="tabPanel"><p>A front-end developer builds the front-end portion of websites and web applications—that is, the part that users actually see and interact with. A front-end developer creates websites and applications using web languages such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript allow users to access and interact with the site or app.</p></div>
        <div class="tabPanel"><p>A back-end developer is someone who builds and maintains the technology needed to power the components which enable the user-facing side of the website to exist. Their back end code adds utility to everything the front-end developer creates.</p></div>
        <div class="tabPanel"><p>A Full Stack Developer is someone who works with the Back End — or server side — of the application as well as the Front End, or client side. Full Stack Developers have to have some skills in a wide variety of coding niches, from databases to graphic design and UI/UX management in order to do their job well.</p></div>
